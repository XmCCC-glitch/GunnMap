```

- `src/map_highlighter.ts` is the Sharp renderer for building and room polygons, including color strips for repeated rooms.
- `src/web_app.ts` serves the React SPA shell and JSON APIs. `src/schedule_render.ts` validates and generates schedules, `src/schedule_legend.ts` draws their legends, and `src/room_response.ts` maps inventory rooms to API responses. `src/output_retention.ts` manages expiry. Never write or expose a shared latest-map URL.
- `web/src/app/` contains the React bootstrap, route table, and persistent navigation shell. `web/src/pages/` contains the four route pages; reusable schedule, room, map, and evacuation behavior belongs under `web/src/features/`; shared controls and notifications belong in `web/src/shared/`.
- `src/domain/room-matching.ts` contains room identity matching shared by the browser and Node server. Keep cross-runtime domain rules outside `web/src/`.
- `src/domain/room-contracts.ts` defines the shared room API types; `src/domain/generated-map-path.ts` defines the personal-map URL rule used by the server and offline/browser code.
- `web/index.html` is the shared SPA shell. Vite builds the browser entry from `web/src/app/main.tsx` into `dist/web/main.js` and `dist/web/ui.css`; the server returns the same shell for `/`, `/evacuation`, `/find-room`, and `/generate-map`.
- `src/evacuation.ts` and `src/data/evacuation_data.json` keep evacuation assignments unconfirmed until a verified plan for the 2026 map is available.
- `src/project.ts` loads the inventory and resolves room IDs and aliases.
- `src/schedule_preview.ts` renders the example schedule; `src/build_n_map.ts` refreshes the working map from the clean September 2026 PNG, which already includes the N-building second floor.
- `src/data/room_regions.json` contains selectable room polygons; `src/data/room_index.csv` is the human-readable index. `src/data/building_regions.json` contains building-level polygons.
- `src/map/` contains source and working map assets. Deliberate `output/demo_*.png` and `output/demo_*.webp` previews may be tracked.
- All code that needs a campus map must use the map assets in this repository's `src/map/`. Server code should resolve files there, and browser code should request the routes or built derivatives backed by those files. Keep generated personal maps in `output/` and built display assets in `dist/web/`.

## Working conventions

- Use Node.js 22.12 or newer, React, and strict TypeScript for browser, server, rendering, and test code. Install dependencies with `npm ci`; keep application source in TypeScript/TSX and do not add a Python runtime. Generated JavaScript belongs in ignored `dist/`.
- Preserve room IDs for identifiable existing rooms and keep `src/data/room_index.csv` aligned with inventory changes. Historical `R069` selections resolve to the printed K5 (`R068`) polygon; lower K6 remains `R070`. Duplicate upper K1/K2/K6 labels stay unselectable until their identities are confirmed.
- Polygon coordinates refer to the 2448 × 1584 map. Keep PNG legends within those dimensions so interactive room targets remain aligned.
- Do not overwrite the source PDF or clean page-one PNG when rebuilding the working map.
- Retain the documented selection scope: V rooms and most athletic spaces are excluded; selectable Bow Gym rooms are BG111, BG138, and BG117.
- Schedule drafts and templates use cookies. Every schedule edit or load must invalidate generated map previews, and stale async results must not navigate to an outdated image.
- Each rendered image has its own URL. Never replace a previous tab's image with another tab's generated map.
- Personal images use no-store and enter the offline cache only after explicit Save offline. Keep public cache upgrades separate from the saved personal image. `src/build_offline.ts` builds a versioned worker from `web/offline/`; include new public dependencies in its precache inputs.
- Build lossless display WebP derivatives with `src/build_map_assets.ts`; never overwrite the source PNGs. Preserve offline Download PNG by encoding the cached display copy on demand. Keep every displayed map's original pixel dimensions.
- Public precache revisions are per resource; reuse only matching revisions from complete previous caches. Retain bounded network fallback and atomic cache activation. Personal maps must never enter the public asset manifest.
- Render requests must pass JSON and same-origin checks, bounded admission and storage reservations before expensive work. Do not trust forwarded client headers implicitly or bypass the generated-image store in HTTP routes.
- Keep browser scripts compatible with the server CSP. Public API/image fetches omit credentials; JavaScript-readable schedule cookies use Secure on HTTPS while localhost development remains usable.
- Use v2 draft/template cookies and keep legacy cookies read-only. Temporary shared schedules must stay separate from the local draft until explicitly saved.
- Do not infer evacuation routes or destinations from the September 2026 site map. All room assignments remain unconfirmed until a current school evacuation plan is verified.
- Put temporary renders in `output/` or a temporary directory; commit only deliberate `demo_*.png` or `demo_*.webp` files for documentation.

## Code design requirements

- Keep modules and components cohesive, loosely coupled, and responsible for one concrete concern. Route pages compose feature behavior and UI; HTTP handlers manage requests and responses rather than drawing maps or implementing schedule rules.
- Prefer simple, efficient, readable code. Extract shared logic when existing callers need it, and use explicit names and normal formatting for complex calculations. Do not introduce generic frameworks, speculative extension points, or abstractions without a current use.
- Do not write fallback, redundant, or speculative code to make uncertain behavior appear to work. Do not guess API field names or try a series of possible IDs. Use the actual documented or implemented contract, validate input at its boundary, and report failures explicitly instead of silently substituting a different business state.
- Ask the user before implementing behavior whose contract or requirements are unclear. Existing code, API implementations, and verified data should establish known behavior; assumptions must not replace missing evidence.
- Keep shared room/API types and domain rules in `src/domain/` so the server, browser, and offline worker use the same definitions. Do not duplicate matching, path validation, or destination formatting rules in pages.
- Remove unused APIs, event listeners, declarations, and styles during refactoring. Check their real callers before removing existing migration or data-protection behavior, and preserve saved user data and the ability to roll back.
- Verify behavior at the boundaries affected by a refactor. Regression tests should cover actual failures and user flows, not duplicate implementation details. Run the verification commands below before marking work complete.

## GitHub account, pull requests, and main branch

- For requests involving a pull request (for example, “help me create PR”), merging, or changing `main`, check the currently authenticated GitHub account with `gh api user --jq .login` before taking any action that would merge into or directly update `main`.
- Only merge a pull request into `main` or push changes directly to `main` when that command returns exactly `Ijustneedanid` or `XmCCC-glitch`. Check again immediately before the merge or push; a Git commit author, email address, or remote URL is not proof of the authenticated account.
- If the account cannot be verified or does not match either allowed login, do not merge or push to `main`. Explain the result to the user and leave any prepared pull request open for an authorized account to merge.
- After creating a pull request, request a Codex review by posting a separate pull request comment containing exactly `@codex review`. Put the trigger in a comment, not at the bottom of the pull request description.

## Verification

- Run `npm run typecheck`, `npm test`, and `npm run build`.
- `npm run dev` builds the browser modules before starting the TypeScript server. Run `npm run build:web` after browser source edits, or restart the development server. `npm start` uses the compiled server and requires `npm run build` first.
- For rendering changes, generate a representative map including a repeated room and N214, and inspect the PNG and legend.
- For interface changes, run `npm run dev -- --port 8000` and check draft restoration, templates, sharing, generation, download, classroom evacuation details, and invalidation after edits.
